# Common Operators

RxJS provides many operators (over 150 of them!), but only a handful are used frequently. Here is a list of common operators with simple examples to show their usage. These examples are largely derived from the [RxJS 5 Operators By Example](https://github.com/btroncone/learn-rxjs/blob/master/operators/complete.md) page:

* map
* mergeMap
